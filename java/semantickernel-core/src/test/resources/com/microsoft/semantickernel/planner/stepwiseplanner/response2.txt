[THOUGHT]
To answer this question, we need to find out who the current president of the United States is and their age. Once we have their age, we can divide it by 2 to get the answer to the second part of the question.

[ACTION]
We can't use any of the provided functions to directly answer this question, so we'll need to perform a web search to find out who the current president is. We can then manually find their age and divide it by 2.

$JSON_BLOB:
{
  "action": "WebSearch.search",
  "action_variables": {"query": "who is the current president of the united states"}
}
